# governance-repo-path.sh — single point of truth for resolving which working
# copy of the governance repo (DS-strategy) a script should read/write.
# (WP-537, peer-session 2026-08-17-06-wp530-parallel-session-architecture,
# consensus with Kimi: two functions with different semantics, not one —
# a future tip-snapshot audit (WP-535 "осталось") needs both paths at once,
# a single resolver would have to be reworked or bypassed for that case.)
# Source, don't execute: `. "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/lib/governance-repo-path.sh"`
#
# Root cause this replaces: 15+ scripts building "$IWE_ROOT/DS-strategy" or
# "$IWE_ROOT/$GOV_REPO" by hand, none of them asking whether the calling
# process is actually inside an isolated git worktree. session-guard.sh itself
# already carries a comment (line ~1779) acknowledging the pattern as known,
# unfixed debt. Confirmed live: session-index.sh writing sessions/00-index.md
# into the canonical checkout while the calling session ran from a worktree
# (WP-537 Находка 1) and close_obligation.py's cards_dir walking upward past
# the intended repo into {{WORKSPACE_DIR}} itself (WP-484, bug-2026-08-14... cd-restores-
# to-parent class).

# resolve_active_worktree — prints the governance repo path a MUTATING
# operation should write to: the worktree the calling process is actually
# running in, if any; the canonical checkout otherwise. Never walks upward
# past the immediate git root (that upward walk is what caused the {{WORKSPACE_DIR}}
# false-positive above) — it only ever trusts `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`
# run from $PWD, nothing more.

# the not-yet-built WP-535 tip-snapshot audit). Do not call this from a

# a repo_dir argument -- MC-sessions isn't a subfolder of any governance
# checkout, its path doesn't depend on which worktree the caller runs in.
# Fails closed (non-zero exit, nothing on stdout) if the checkout is
# missing -- callers running under `set -e` abort instead of silently
# falling back to writing inside DS-strategy again (that fallback is
# exactly the split-brain this move exists to close).
